## Problem Overview

The current financial ecosystem is centralized, and traditional financial
institutions are typically in control of the financial services they offer.
This means that users have to trust these institutions with their funds
and personal data. Additionally, traditional financial institutions often
have high fees and restrictions, which limit access to financial services
for many people.
To address these issues, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform can be
built. This platform would allow users to access financial services such
as borrowing, lending, and trading in a decentralized and trustless
manner. A decentralized platform would remove the need for
intermediaries such as banks, enabling users to interact directly with
each other. This would provide a more inclusive and accessible financial
ecosystem, particularly for those who are currently excluded from
traditional financial services.
However, building a DeFi platform presents a number of challenges.
Firstly, the platform needs to be designed with security in mind, as it will
handle sensitive financial data and transactions. Secondly, the platform
needs to be scalable, as it will need to handle a large number of users
and transactions. Thirdly, the platform needs to have a user-friendly
interface, so that users can easily navigate and utilize the platform's
features. Finally, the platform needs to be compliant with relevant
regulations, particularly regarding money laundering and know-yourcustomer (KYC) requirements.
